# Information for International Travellers

## OWASP New Zealand Day 2020

Effective on 1 October 2019, new travel requirements took effect for visitors to New Zealand from Visa Waiver countries.

Here are the requirements, as we (the conference committee) understand them - the usual "does not constitute legal advice" disclaimers apply:

1. If you are in one of the groups listed on Immigration New Zealand's [Travelers who do not need an NZeTA](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/about-visa/nzeta#https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/tools-and-information/your-journey-to-new-zealand/before-you-travel-to-new-zealand/travellers-who-do-not-need-nzeta/slider) page: no worries, you can just turn up;

2. If you are travelling on a passport meeting the conditions listed on the New Zealand [Visa Waiver Countries](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/tools-and-information/general-information/visa-waiver-countries) page: You will need to obtain a **[New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA)](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/about-visa/nzeta)**;

3. If you are travelling on any other passport, you will need to apply for a visa to visit New Zealand:

    a. If you are visiting New Zealand, and will *attend* the conference and/or a training class as part of your visit, you should be able to travel on a **[Visitor Visa](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/about-visa/visitor-visa)**. This should be true, even if you are presenting a talk at the main conference, because speakers do not receive compensation.

    b. For those visiting New Zealand to *present* a training class, we have been made aware of conflicting information provided by Immigration New Zealand staff and embassy officials. Some trainers have been advised they can come to New Zealand on a **[Business Visitor Visa](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/about-visa/business-visitors-visa)**, while others have been informed they must apply for a **[Specific Purpose Work Visa](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/about-visa/specific-purpose-or-event-work-visa)**. The latter visa requires more documentation, and takes longer to process, so please plan accordingly.

If you're unsure what travel documentation you need, we highly recommend you [contact Immigration New Zealand](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/contact) early.
