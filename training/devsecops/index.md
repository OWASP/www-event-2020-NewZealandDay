# CANCELLED Class - DevSecOps: Automating Security in DevOps

## One-Day Interactive Training - OWASP New Zealand Day 2020

## Abstract

Modern enterprises are implementing the technical and cultural changes required to embrace DevOps methodology. DevSecOps extends DevOps, by introducing security early into the SDLC process, thereby minimizing the security vulnerabilities and enhancing the software security posture.

## Course Objectives

Course attendees will learn how to:

* Create a security culture/mindset among the already integrated "DevOps" team
* Find and fix security bugs as early in SDLC as possible
* The culture promotes the philosophy "Security is everyone's problem"
* Integrate all security software centrally and utilize the results more effectively
* Measure and reduce applications' attack surface

## Target Audience

DevOps engineers, security and solutions architects. System administrators will also strongly benefit from this course as it will give them a holistic approach towards application security.

Anybody with a background in IT or related to software development whether a developer or a manager can attend this course to get an insight into DevOps and DevSecOps.

## Course Details - As Planned

**Date:** Thursday, 20 February 2020   
**Time:** 8:45 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.   
**Course Fee:** NZ $625.00 (plus EventBrite fees)

**Attendees Should Bring:**

Students will be provided with a DevSecOps-Lab VM which is completely optional to download and use for the course. If you are intending to use it then the Laptop requires a minimum of 16GB of RAM and 40 GB of extra space.

**Attendees Will Be Provided:**

The attendees will receive a DevSecOps-Lab VM (designed by the NotSoSecure team) containing all the code, scripts and tools that are used for building the entire DevSecOps pipeline.

**Instructors:** Anand Tiwari and Rohit Salecha, [NotSoSecure](https://www.notsosecure.com/)   

## Course Overview

Modern enterprises are implementing the technical and cultural changes required to embrace DevOps methodology. DevSecOps extends DevOps by introducing security early into the SDLC process, the security vulnerabilities and enhancing the software security posture. In this workshop, we will show how this can be achieved through a series of live demonstrations and practical examples.

As part of this workshop attendees will receive a state-of-the-art DevSecOps tool-chest comprising of various open-source tools and scripts to help the DevOps engineers in automating security within the CI/CD pipeline. While the workshop uses Java/J2EE technology stack, the workshop is language agnostic and similar tools can be used against other application development frameworks.

A Short preview of our course is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ILrzYLpr14).
