# CANCELLED Class - Advanced Pwning & Fixing Node.js Apps: Shells, Injections, and Fun!

## One-Day Interactive Training - OWASP New Zealand Day 2020

## Abstract

This course is the culmination of years of experience gained via practical penetration testing of JavaScript applications as well as countless hours spent doing research. We have structured this course around the OWASP Security Testing Guide. It covers the OWASP Top Ten and specific attack vectors against Node.js apps. This course provides participants with actionable skills that can be applied immediately.

Please note our courses are 100% hands-on, we do not lecture students with boring bullet points and theories, instead we give you practical challenges and help you solve them, teaching you how to troubleshoot common issues and get the most out of this training. Training then continues after the course through our frequently updated training portal, for which you keep lifetime access, as well as unlimited email support.

The day starts with a brief introduction to Node.js, then continues with a look at static analysis, moves on to dynamic checks, and finishes off with a nice CTF session to test the skills gained.

## Course Objectives

This course will take any student and make sure that:

* The general level of proficiency is much higher than when they came
* The skills acquired can be immediately applied to Node.js app security assessments
* Skills can be sharpened via continued education in our training portal for free
* The student is equipped to defeat common Node.js app assessment challenges
* People who are new to JavaScript security will learn a lot in this training.
* Advanced students will come out with enhanced skills and more efficient workflows
* The skills gained are highly practical and applicable to real-world assessments

## Course Details 

**Date:** Wednesday, 19 February 2020

**Time:** 8:45 a.m. to 5:30 pm.

**Course Fee:** NZ $625.00 (plus EventBrite fees)

**Target Audience:**

Any Node.js/JavaScript developer, penetration tester, or person interested in Node.js and JavaScript security will benefit from attending this training regardless of the initial skill level.

This course is for beginners, intermediate and advanced level students. While beginners are introduced to the nuances of Node.js app security from scratch, intermediate and advanced level learners get to perfect both their knowledge and skills on the subject. Extra mile challenges are available in every module to help more advanced students polish their skills.
        
The course is crafted in a way that regardless of your skill level you will significantly improve your JavaScript security skills:
        
If you are new and cannot complete the labs during the class, that is OK, as you keep training portal access, you will learn a lot in the class but can continue from home with the training portal.
        
If you are more advanced in JavaScript security you can try to complete the labs in full and then take the CTF challenges, you will likely also attempt to complete some exercises from home later

**Prerequisite Skills:**

This course has no prerequisites as it is designed to accommodate students with different skills:

* Advanced students will enjoy comprehensive labs, extra miles and CTF challenges
* Less experienced students complete what they can during the class, and can continue at their own pace from home using the training portal.

That said, the more you learn about the following ahead of the course, the more you will get out of the course:

* Linux command line basics
* Node.js basics

**Attendees Should Bring:** 

A laptop with the following specifications:

* Ability to connect to wireless and wired networks
* Ability to read PDF files 
* Administrative rights: USB allowed, the ability to deactivate AV, firewall, install tools, etc.
* Knowledge of the BIOS password, in case VT is disabled
* Minimum 8GB of RAM (recommended: 16GB+)
* 60GB+ of free disk space (to copy a lab VM and other goodies)
* VirtualBox 6.0 or greater, including the “VirtualBox Extension Pack”

**Instructors:** Abraham Aranguren and Anirudh Anand, [7A Security](https://7asecurity.com/)
