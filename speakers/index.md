#### Abstract

One constant in IT is that things change. And the pace of change increases over time. Change introduces risk, so how do organisations manage their IT security risk in this environment of constant and fast paced change?

This talk delves into the issues posed by these changes for organisations and security teams in particular. It will cover concepts ranging from governance structures for dealing with change and risk, to technical change and current and emerging threats.
