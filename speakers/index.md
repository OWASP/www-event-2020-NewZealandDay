## OWASP New Zealand Day 2020

## Track One - Introductory and Management Topics

### Session One (10:05 - 12:30)

### High-Speed Security   
*Nick von Dadelszen - Lateral Security*

#### Abstract

One constant in IT is that things change. And the pace of change increases over time. Change introduces risk, so how do organisations manage their IT security risk in this environment of constant and fast paced change?

This talk delves into the issues posed by these changes for organisations and security teams in particular. It will cover concepts ranging from governance structures for dealing with change and risk, to technical change and current and emerging threats.

#### Speaker Biography

Nick is co-founder and technical director of Lateral Security. He has been working in the New Zealand Security industry since the late 90’s and in that time has worked with the majority of New Zealand large organisations and government agencies.

Nick manages the delivery of Lateral Security’s services, which includes deep technical services such as penetration testing and red teaming, as well as governance and advisory services. Nick still likes to get his hands dirty and is a key security advisor to some critical government agencies.

### The Perimeter Has Been Shattered: Attacking and Defending Mobility and IoT on the Enterprise Network
*Georgia Weidman - Bulb Security*


#### Abstract

Mobility and the Internet of Things (IoT) have disrupted the corporate enterprise network on the scale that PCs disrupted mainframes in the 1980s. Yet most enterprises continue to approach security as if though there is still a hard perimeter with nothing but corporate-owned end points running against internal applications. Mobility, however, means employee-owned end points connecting over public carrier networks to cloud applications. Traditional perimeter security simply doesn’t address this. From mobile-based phishing to Bluetooth-based attacks, mobile and IoT have fundamentally changed the threat landscape. In this talk we will look at the modern threat landscape, the security controls currently available on the market (such as mobile threat defense and mobile application management), and provide real world examples of how they fall short under simulated attack. Finally, we will look at practical ways to improve enterprise security around mobile and IoT as well as cause the defensive products to evolve to be more robust.

### What's the Worst That Could Happen?
*Petra Smith - Aura Information Security*

#### Abstract

From digital surveillance to technology-facilitated abuse to algorithmic bias, you don’t have to go far to find examples of how technology can cause real harm to real people. Technology can fail or be abused in ways its creators never anticipated, and have serious unintended consequences, especially for people who are already vulnerable, marginalised or persecuted.

When we're making something for other people to use, we want to make sure it’s safe and secure. Threat modelling is a great way to discover how the thing we're building could be misused, but it relies on our ability to imagine all the ways that someone could use it to cause harm. How can we be confident that we’re keeping people safe when they face threats that are literally unimaginable?

To answer "what could go wrong," we need to go beyond the power of imagination and get out of our comfort zone. Aimed at developers, testers and everyone else involved in making things people use, this talk will introduce practical actions you can take to get to know your most vulnerable users, and offer strategies for creating things with their safety and security in mind.

#### Speaker Biography

Petra grew up wanting to be Sailor Mercury – the nerdy blue-haired one who used computers to protect the world from cosmic evil. Now she’s a #purpleteam cybersecurity consultant at Aura Information Security, which is pretty close. She gets kind of ranty about privacy, trust, and making digital spaces safe and inclusive for everyone.
